# Open Chat

A habbo-like web chat application made with Node.js, Express and Socket.IO. You can watch it live now here: https://open-chat-384018.ew.r.appspot.com

Or you can run it locally following these steps (assuming you have Node installed):
- Download or clone the project.
- Navigate to the root folder.
- Run "npm i".
- Run "npm start".

Now you can see the app at http://localhost:3000

If the app doesn't load properly you may need to use the "Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin" extension for Google Chrome in order to enable the browser to load the character images. Once installed you will need to activate it clicking on the grey C letter, it will turn to orange. Remember to deactivate it if a webpage is not loading.
