# Pixel Chat

A habbo-like web chat application made with Node.js, Express and Socket.IO. You can watch it live now here: https://www.pixelchat.es

I'm remaking part of the project to use React for the UI instead of creating it entirely from JS as I did. If you want to see the code of the version deployed in https://www.pixelchat.es navigate to the master branch.
