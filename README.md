# Pixel Chat

A habbo-like web chat application made with Node.js, Express and Socket.IO. Usually you can watch it live here: https://www.pixelchat.es but it's not working right now. I'll try to fix it as soon as possible.

I'm remaking part of the project to use React for the UI instead of creating it entirely from JS as I did.
